			<p>Welcome to CeduScan!</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>CeduScan is a simple technology that allows you to scan and decode colombian ID cards.
			The format of the bardcode is PDF 417 which can be scanned with any barcode scanner,
			however, the bits and pieces of information are decoded and you won't understand the information.</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>Our technology allows us to read the barcode AND decode the information so you it can be presented in a simple and understandable way for usage in your different applications, processes or needs.</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>Feel free to explore the website, try the free demo or connect to the API to access from your app. Remember we also have an Android app that you can download form the Play Store and test it out for yourself. Make sure to contact us if you want to integrate our solution in your current user experience.</p>
